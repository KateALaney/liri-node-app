# LIRI Node App
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command-line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.  LIRI will search for concerts, movies, music, and run a random.txt file which generates calls for concerts, movies, and music.

## App Organization
LIRI is made to run four commands: `concert-this`, which will print all concert venues for a particular band; `spotify-this-song`, which will print the name, album, artist, and a link to the song in Spotify; `movie-this`, which will print a catalogue of information for any movie selected; and `do-what-it-says`, which will run the command in a text file called "random.txt".

## Instructions for Use
1. In order to run LIRI, you will first need to create a `.env` file, as well as obtain and replace API keys for `spotify`, `bands`, and `movies`.
